""" Python's Default Behavior: Synchronous Execution
Python executes code line by line in a blocking manner.
Each operation must complete before the next one starts.
‚óè This is how Python normally works unless explicitly told to run asynchronously
Python Supports Asynchronous Execution Using asyncio
Python can run non-blocking tasks using asyncio.
Instead of waiting for one task to finish, multiple tasks run concurrently."""
